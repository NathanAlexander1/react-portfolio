      <p>Hello! My name is Nathan Alexander and I am a full stack software engineer. I recently earned my <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://bootcamp.uw.edu/coding/"> cerificate in full stack development</a> from the University of Washington's coding bootcamp and am eager to dive into the field of web development!</p>
      
      <p>Prior to shifting my career towards tech, I worked in the non-profit sector. Most recently, I worked for the Humane Society of the United States, helping to better our food system to improve human health, animal welfare and the wellbeing of the planet.</p>

      <p>I am still very interested in making the world a better and more sustainable place and am eager to continuing to develop my programming literacy with a company or organization that shares my values and passions</p>
